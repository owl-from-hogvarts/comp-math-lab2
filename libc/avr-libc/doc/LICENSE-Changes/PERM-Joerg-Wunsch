Thank you!

The original BSD license had four clauses, where the `No advertising'
clause was #3, and later officially dropped.  Individual *BSD
developers later on also dropped clause #4 ("name ... may not be used
to endorse"), which led to the two-clause template we had by now.

For those files where I hold the copyright, I don't mind whether it's
the 2-clause or 3-clause version.  I agree we should settle for one of
both, and see to convert the remaining files (given author's
permission).  It seems converting everything to the 3-clause version
is less work, so let's pick this one.

Thanks again!
