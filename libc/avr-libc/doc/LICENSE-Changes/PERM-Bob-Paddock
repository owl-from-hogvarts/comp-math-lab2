Yes you may change the file.  I have been following the discussion on the

Just so this is clear in my own mind, is is ok to say "This product was 
developed using GCC and avr-libc" on my web site if I ever have a product to 
sell?

It would be bad if I listed anyones name that I find in the code on the web 
site where trying to sell product?
