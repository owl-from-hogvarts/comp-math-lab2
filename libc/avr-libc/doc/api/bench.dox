/** \page benchmarks Benchmarks

The results below can only give a rough estimate of the resources 
necessary for using certain library functions. There is a number 
of factors which can both increase or reduce the effort required:

\li Expenses for preparation of operands and their stack are not 
considered.

\li In the table, the size includes all additional functions (for
example, function to multiply two integers) but they are only linked
from the library.
    
\li Expenses of time of performance of some functions essentially depend
on parameters of a call, for example, qsort() is recursive, and sprintf() 
receives parameters in a stack.

\li Different versions of the compiler can give a significant difference in
code size and execution time. For example, the dtostre() function, compiled
with avr-gcc 3.4.6, requires 930 bytes. After transition to avr-gcc 4.2.3,
the size become 1088 bytes.
